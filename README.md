# Countries

## What is this?

This project is a solution to a technical assignment provided by Majority. This Android application
uses REST API to retrieve data about countries from [restcountries.com](https://restcountries.com/).

## How to install it?

Download the latest release from the releases page.

## How does it work?

The data is shown in a scrollable list of countries received from the API. Click on each of the
items opens a bottom sheet dialog with extended information about the country. Additionally, users
can search countries by their names using a separate API endpoint. The application allows sorting
the list by name or population, which is implemented locally.

## What can be improved?

The countries can be filtered locally. For example, the application can filter countries by region,
currency, languages, etc.
